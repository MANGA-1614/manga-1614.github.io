Elemental Write-Up
    All Personas were chosen for their resistance and I used a calculator to check their inheritances.
        Best Personas would have Null Phys, Gun, Bless, AND Curse with 1 skill, but have 1 weakness at most.
            Personas that fulfill this requirement:

                Lucifer [Drain Curse, Null Phys/Gun, Bless weakness] -> MT-Almighty
        Priority:
            Innate Null Bless AND Null Curse, or higher levels.
            Innate Null Phys OR Null Gun, or higher levels.
            One weakness.
    All Elemental builds follow the same template:
